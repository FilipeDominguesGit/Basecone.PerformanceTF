## BasedataService

### Error reports

- [x] OperationCanceled.Exception
- [x] ObjectDisposed.Exception
- [x] StructureMap Exceptions
- [x] IIS pool shutting down
- [ ] Redis timeouts

### Affected clients and applications

- Backoffice 
- Login
- Belgium offices
- Intercom
- Other minor parts of the application

### Actions during investigation

- New relic and kibana logs investigation
- Last release code change investigation
- Checked load balancers 
- Checked app status on each machine
- Checked windows event viewer
- Checked IIS logs and crash dumps 
- Checked application pools configuration *

### Mitigation Actions

- Reduced number of IIS workers on IIS app pool 
- Temporary removed some code from and service that was causing high load
- Temporary increase of the number of allowed erros on the app pool before causing a shutting down


### Error cause

After the investigation we found the max memory size of the app pool process on IIS was set to 350mb that was causing the app pool to constantly restart and shut down after a while since the app pool was using a bit over the limit.

This probably started happening after the machine upgrade since we could handle more request with the new machines causing higher memory usage and going over the 350mb limit.

### Fix 

- Removed memory limit
- Set app pool recycling to 29h
- Adjusted the workers number

### Future changes

- Review the IIS settings for all applications and deploy scripts
- Change app pool to 64bit when possible and after testing

## Document Artifact

### Error reports

- [x] Document Converter errors when contacting Doc art
- [x] Web portal errors when contacting Doc art
- [x] 2 Machines not being used  (no load/throughput reported)

### Actions during investigation

- Checked load balancer
- Checked each machine health
- Reviewed IIS settings and logs
- Reviewed event viewer logs
- Reviewed kibana logs ( no errors )

### Mitigation Actions

- Removed the affected machines from load balancer

### Error cause

2 machines were created on the wrong security group and had no internet access.


### Fix

Recreate machines on the correct security group and re-add them to the load balancer.

### Future improvements

- Change app pool to 64bits
- Review Docart Healthchecks
